# Algorithms

The architect's toolbox - the specific computational techniques that show up *inside*
real systems. Not LeetCode; these are the building blocks you need to recognize when
reading a case study or designing one.

Planned:

- [x] [Consistent hashing](./consistent-hashing.md)
- [ ] Bloom filter · Counting bloom
- [ ] HyperLogLog (cardinality) · Count-min sketch (frequency)
- [ ] Merkle trees (anti-entropy, verification)
- [ ] CRDTs (conflict-free replicated data types; semilattice sidebar: why CRDTs cannot disagree)
- [ ] Vector clocks / Lamport timestamps
- [ ] Raft / Paxos / PBFT (consensus) - theory in [`../foundations/distributed-systems`](../foundations/distributed-systems)
- [ ] Gossip / SWIM (membership)
- [ ] Token bucket vs leaky bucket (rate limiting)
- [ ] LSM-tree and B-tree mechanics (the why lives in [`../foundations/data-systems`](../foundations/data-systems))
- [ ] Quorum (R + W > N)
- [ ] Geohashing / H3
- [ ] Reservoir sampling
- [ ] Hashes and signatures: what they actually guarantee
