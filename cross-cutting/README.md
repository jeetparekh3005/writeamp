# Cross-Cutting Concerns

The non-functional requirements that cut across *every* topic and are the architect's
daily vocabulary. They don't belong to any one system - they're lenses you apply to all
of them.

Planned:

- [ ] **Reliability** - SLOs, error budgets, redundancy, graceful degradation, chaos
- [ ] **Observability** - logs, metrics, traces; the "three pillars" and what each is for
- [ ] **Security** - authn/authz, secrets, defense in depth, threat modeling
- [ ] **Performance** - latency budgets, tail latency, caching strategy, profiling
- [ ] **Cost** - the fourth axis; cost/request, build-vs-buy economics
- [ ] **AI-native NFRs** - the operational view; eval & regression point at the [evals anchor](../ai-systems/llmops/README.md), grounding, token cost, prompt-injection, non-determinism
